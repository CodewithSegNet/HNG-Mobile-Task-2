# Task Brief: Create a Program for Data Encryption and Decryption using GitHub Gist

- Objective: Develop a program using Dart, Javascript, Swift, or Kotlin, to encrypt and decrypt data securely. Share the solution as a GitHub Gist for public collaboration and code reuse. It should be case sensitive.

- Requirements:
Programming Language: Choose one of the following:
Dart (Flutter support optional)
React (using JavaScript or TypeScript)
Swift (iOS application or CLI)
Kotlin (Android or CLI)
Native Android (Java or Kotlin)

- Functionality:
The program must implement the following:

- Encryption: A method to securely encrypt a given input string using an encryption algorithm.

- Decryption: A method to decrypt the encrypted string back to its original state.

- Key: A secret string that is used to encrypt and decrypt.
Encryption/Decryption Algorithm: Create your custom encryption algorithm that uses a string for encryption and decryption.

- Input/Output:
* Encryption Input: A plaintext string and a secret key.
* Output: Encrypted string.
* Decryption Input: An encrypted string and a secret key.
* Output: Decrypted string.

- Code Structure: Provide modular, reusable functions or methods for encryption and decryption. Add comments and documentation for code clarity.

- Deliverables:
* GitHub Gist: Create a Gist and include the following:
Source code file(s)
Instructions for usage
Example inputs and outputs

- Bonus Features: Add an interactive interface (e.g., Flutter UI, React web form, or Android app UI) & upload app to Appetize
